<h2>Basics of using CSS columns in a layout</h2>

<h3>Focus on</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>column-count</code></li>
<li><code>column-gap</code></li>
<li><code>column-rule</code></li>
<li>non-semantic grouping tag (<code>div</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>CSS columns work a lot like columns in a text book or other pring publication: they flow content from the left-most column to the right-most column, automatically breaking up the contents so the columns are equal height.</p>

<p>When there are images in the content, the way in which the browser divides up the content into columns depends on how the images will "flow" - obviously they can't be broken in the middle. You can control how the browser will put in breaks with <code>break-before</code> or <code>break-after</code> properties. These are not needed in this exercise. There are other ways to control content and layout with columns (see lecture notes for resources)</p>

<p>One useful style when you're working with columns (and later, with CSS grid) is using the feature-image class to set the width of images to 100%. That way, they are always the width of their container, even if that width changes.</p>

<p>Be sure that you read the columns lecture notes, and view the video tutorials.</p>

<p>There is a screenshot of our goal, and we'll do this in class, so you should be able to finish it up quickly.</p>
