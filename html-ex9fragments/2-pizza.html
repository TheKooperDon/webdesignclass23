<h2 id="our-story">Origins of Wy'east</h2>
<p>James and Ann started making pizza in a camper trailer on the side of the road in Portland, Oregon. Over a four year period we learned how to make great pizza and build a loyal following. We have always loved time spent in outdoor environments and have hiked and camped extensively through the Appalachian and Cascade mountain ranges. The name Wy’east comes from the native name for the mountain we now call Mt. Hood, Portland’s namesake mountain and the source of much of our inspiration. We moved back to our hometown Milwaukee Wisconsin in 2013 so that our families could eat our pizza too.</p>

<h2>About Our Pizza</h2>
<p>A very hot oven and a long fermented dough are the essential ingredients for a great pizza. We honor age old bread baking traditions, so naturally the dough is the most highly regarded component of our pizza. Our crust is thin with an outer edge that puffs up and shows its bread like structure. This edge is the cornicione, it is the result of the long fermentation and hand stretching process. The pies are baked quickly so that they do not dry out but get crispy and slightly charred in all the right places. This char is a natural product of carmelizing sugars in the dough released from it’s long fermentation and the extreme heat of the oven. Char, and the flavor contrasts it provides are highly sought after by both pizzaiolo’s and critics alike.</p>
