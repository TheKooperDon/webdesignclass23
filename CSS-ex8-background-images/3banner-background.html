<h2>Cultural Requirements</h2>
<p>Most viburnums prefer full sun but will adjust to partial shade. They like a moderately fertile soil with a pH between 5.6 - 6.6., although many do just fine in alkaline soils. In general, viburnums are not terrible particular about where they grow.</p>
<p>That few pests will bother viburnums is one of the reasons they have become so popular in the landscape. Recently the Viburnum Leaf Beetle (VLB) has been introduced into North America trough Canada and has begun making its way south.</p>

<p>Almost all viburnums produce attractive clusters of drupes type fruits which are popular with birds, wildlife and humans.
