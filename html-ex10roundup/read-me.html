<h2>Using all the semantic structural tags together</h2>
<h3>Focus on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 Semantic Structural Tags:
<ul>
	<li><code>header</code></li>
	<li><code>main</code></li>
	<li><code>footer</code></li>
	<li><code>article</code></li>
	<li><code>section</code></li>
	<li><code>nav</code></li>
	<li><code>aside</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in-page linking with fragments</li>
<li>embedded styles using element selectors</li>
<li>CSS <code>background-color</code> property</li>
<li>CSS <code>border</code> property</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Semantic structural tags are a challenge to learn. <strong>But learn them we must.</strong> They are a bit more challenging than most other tags, because most other tags are pretty obvious: when you need a list, you need a list! The semantic structural tags require us all to think about the meaning and structure of our page, and all its parts, in deep ways, and consider multiple options.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding and memorizing the specifications for each semantic structural tag is essential.</strong></p>

<p><code>index.html</code> is a long page filled with information about semantic structural tags. The page contents include the specifications and explanations about how and when to use each one of these tags based upon the content of a web page.</p>

<p><mark>Read the page information on <code>index.html</code> before you begin.</mark> This is the information you need to know to be able to use these tags correctly.</p>

<p>In most pages we'll create for our projects, you won't need to use <strong>all</strong> the HTML5 semantic structural tags. However, in this exercise, you must use them all, and you must use them correctly.</p>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<h4>Start with the markup:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Begin by reading the content of the page. It is the information about each tag and how to use it.</li>
	<li>Based upon that information, put the tags into the markup.</li>
	<li>Begin with <code>header, main, footer</code>. Once they are in the page, you can consider the other tags. These come first, though.</li>
	<li>Now move to <code>article, section, nav, aside</code></li>
	<li>If you're not sure which tag to use and/or where to use it, <strong><mark>read the specification</mark></strong>. It's right there on the page!</li>
	<li>The "Semantic Structural Tags" hyperlinks need to link in the page to the two content areas represented: sectioning and non-sectioning. You'll need to create fragments in the page, and then put the proper content into the <code>href</code> attribute in the hyperlinks. See HTML Exercise 9 for more information: we just learned this.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Then write your styles:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Use an embedded style sheet. No inline styles.</li>
	<li>Use element selectors; this is the last time we'll be using them exclusively or extensively.</li>
	<li>Put a <code>border</code> on all four sides of the <code>header, main, footer</code> elements.</li>
	<li>Put a <code>background-color</code> in the <code>article, section, nav, aside</code> elements.</li>
	<li>Use the <a href="https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/" target="_blank">HTML outliner</a> to see if your outline makes sense.</li>
	<li>There are NO screenshots of a completed project to help you. <strong>You need to figure this out based upon the meaning of the content in the page, and the specification of each of these tags.</strong> This isn't about trying to "copy" something but rather to <em>understand</em> it.</li> 
	<li>However, there is a screenshot of a very simply styled layout to assist you in understanding how the page might be designed. This should give you clues about the role of each piece of information. <mark>This is <strong>NOT</strong> what you are asked to style. This is to help you make decisions about the content of the page.</mark>. We haven't even learned how to do a two-column layout anyway. That is not what this assignmen asks you to do. But this screenshot might help you understand the relationship between semantic structural tags and layout.</li>
	<li>The use of heading tags can help you figure this out (remember that all section headings in new sectioning tags use <code>h2</code> tag; also remember section headings are sometimes optional, sometimes required, depending on what tag it is and issues of usability). 
	<li>However, your styles as they display should help you figure out whether things are in the correct place in the markup</li>
	<li>Use whatever colors you want</li>
</ol>

<h4>Finish with fragments/hyperlinks:</h4>
<p>Finish by creating in-page links to the specific locations in the page content for "Non-Sectioning" and "Sectioning" under the heading "Semantic Structural Tags". You'll need to use fragments in the page content so those two hyperlinks link to that content.</p>

<p>None of the other anchor tags need to link to anything. This is, after all, a page of a pretend site.</p>
