    <p>Use the different text-styling elements to mark up the text appropriately. The text itself should suggest the element needed, but use the screen shot for guidance. As you read the text, consider its role and its content. The text itself will seem a little random, because you need opportunities to use lots of different tags. The text has been marked up in paragraphs for you.

    The use of <strong>emphasis</strong> (the <code>em</code> tag) is usually to signal a change in meaning through a change in emphasis. Consider the difference between the identical sentence, with different emphasis (emphasis on "I" in the first, and on "last" in the second):
    <p>
    I didn't <em>steal</em> the last cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>I</em> didn't steal the last cookie.

    Notice how in the paragraph above, the bold text in the screen shot draws the eye and helps you find the beginning of the text? This is a common print convention in magazines or newspapers (digital and analog), which helps the sighted viewer find the beginning of a story on a page that has a lot of other information on it (other stories, advertisements, etc). The tag that creates this visual pathway is <b>non-semantic</b> because the bold text doesn't meaning anything special; it is just at the beginning, so the visual formatting grabs the eye.
