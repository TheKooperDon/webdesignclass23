<h3>
  Description 
</h3>
<p>
  Viburnums are well behaved members of the honeysuckle family. They are either shrubs or trees. The tree forms may require some pruning to achieve the desired shape.The U.S. National Arboretum has done extensive breeding for hardy, pest resistant varieties.
</p>
<p>   
  Viburnums work great as hedges or in mass groupings and also make interesting specimen plants or anchors in borders.<h4>
  </p>
<h3>
  Cultural Requirements
</h3>
<p>
  Most viburnums prefer full sun but will adjust to partial shade. They like a moderately fertile soil with a pH between 5.6 - 6.6., although many do just fine in alkaline soils. In general, viburnums are not terrible particular about where they grow.
  </p>
  <p> 
  That few pests will bother viburnums is one of the reasons they have become so popular in the landscape. Recently the Viburnum Leaf Beetle (VLB) has been introduced into North America trough Canada and has begun making its way south.
</p>
<h3>
  Foliage 
</h3>
<p>
  There is no singular viburnum foliage. It can be rounded, lance-shape or toothed, smooth, velvety or rough. There are some evergreen and semi-evergreen varieties and many deciduous varieties with outstanding fall color. 
</p>
<h3>
  Fruit 
  </h3>
<p>
  Almost all viburnums produce attractive clusters of drupes type fruits which are popular with birds, wildlife and humans. However, most Viburnums are not self-pollinating and will require another variety to cross-pollinate with and yield fruit.

<h4>
  Edible Fruits
</h4>
<p>
The Oregonian Viburnum trilobum 'Wentworth' Edible viburnums, also known as highbush cranberries, are worth a closer look for their beauty and their value as edible berries. Although no relation to real cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon), these viburnums taste similar, produce more berries and are easier to grow than cranberries.
</p> 
<p>Viburnum lantana, or the Wayfaring Tree, produces berries that are edible, but mostly used as famine food. They are not succulent.
</p>
<h4>Toxic Fruit</h4>
<p>
Generally, viburnum berries are not known to be toxic, although they don't necessarily taste very good.
</p>
<p> Guelder-rose (Viburnum opulus) was introduced as a cultivated ornamental and can grow across southern Canada. Occasionally, the shrub may become naturalized. The fears of serious poisoning reported in older literature seem unfounded. Humans who ingest the berries may experience mild symptoms.
</p>
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>
    Most viburnums have either white or pinkish flowers which are sometimes fragrant. The flowers themselves come in three major types: 1) Flat clusters of florets, 2) Flat umbels outlined with larger flowers, resembling lacecap hydrangeas and 3) Dome-shaped, snowball like clusters.
  </p>
  <p>  
    The fragrant varieties that are most familiar in the landscape are native to Asia.
