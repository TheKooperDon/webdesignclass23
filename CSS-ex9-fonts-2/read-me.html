<h2>Sizing fonts and adding other font styling</h2>
<h3>Focus on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changing fonts with <code>font-family</code> property</li>
<li>Understanding inheritance and how it allows for efficient typographic design</li>
<li>Building proper font stacks</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a></li>
<li>Sizing fonts using our "em" and "rem" formula</li>
<li>Understanding proporational relationships within typographic design</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Use the screen shot to help guide to to style the blog page. Replicate the screen shot as closely as you can. The layout styling is done already so you can focus on the font styling.</p>

<p>This page doesn't zero out margins on headings, so you'll need to take care of refining that styling when you get to that point. Our font video tutorials 8 and 9 should help you with this, since they depict much of this process.</p>

<p>These are our "best practices" for setting up fonts. I have stricken the alignment one, since that isn't needed here, but the rest are relavant to this exercise and to all your work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up the font family for the site in a style rule for the <code>body</code> tag. That way your fonts are unified and you ONLY need to write style rules for elements that use a different font (probably your headings, and perhaps your menu text). I require that you do this. It is a formula.</li> 
<li>Set up your styles to use root ems for the size of the type. I require that you do this. It is a formula.</li>
<li>Use ems for any of the other proportional styles (line height, letter spacing, word spacing)</li>
<li><s>Most text should be aligned to the left. Don’t center large quantities of text. If in doubt, ask me. I’ll probably tell you not to center it.</s></li> 
<li>Use google fonts for anything that isn’t “web safe.” But don’t use too many because it slows performance, and too many fonts is like too much salt in food anyway.</li>
<li>Always build good font stacks with three choices: first choice font, second choice font, generic font family</li>
<li>Always be sure that the fonts you put in your font stack are the same font family, and that you end with the correct generic font family for any font stack using serif, sans-serif or monospace fonts. Do not mix and match font families for serif, sans-serif or monospace.</li>
<li>For Google Font font stacks that have serif, sans-serif or monospace as their pre-set generic font family in the stack that you copy and paste, you need to add a second choice font. Choose a web-safe font that is close to the appearance of the Google font you selected. I can help you make those choices.</li>
<li>For Google Font font stacks that end in cursive, you MUST replace “cursive” with either serif or sans-serif – whichever font family is closest to the design you chose. The reason for this is because websafe cursive fonts won’t look anything like your google font choice, and will ruin your design. You also need to choose a web safe font for the second choice that matches the generic font family you choose to replace “cursive.”</li>
</ol>


<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Use the screen shot and our video recap tutorials to help you style the blog page. Replicate the screen shot as closely as you can, but don't worry about the color of the hyperlinks. Maybe they're blue, maybe they're purple, doesn't matter. Everything else does, though. Be sure to follow the "best practices" above.</p>

<p>The fonts you need are both Google Fonts: Roboto Condensed and Grenze.</p>

<p>You will need the following properties to complete the exercise:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>font-family</code></li>
<li><code>font-size</code></li>
<li><code>line-height</code></li>
<li><code>letter-spacing</code></li>
<li><code>word-spacing</code></li>
<li><code>font-weight</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to create some new style rules, and they will use descendant and element selectors. You'll also add to some existing styles. The video gives you the answers, so be sure to watch it!</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>You want to be sure you've written valid markup and valid styles. Use the online validator tools to check your work. If there are errors, <strong>read what the validator says about them</strong> and check the lines in your markup where the errors occur. </p>

<p>You shouldn't get an error from the copy-and-paste link to Google Fonts, but if you ever do, don't worry about it because you cannot change it. Any other errors need to be fixed, however.</p>
